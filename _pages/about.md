I am a Masters's Econ student at the [Department of Economics](https://econdse.org/) at Delhi School of Economics. I graduated from [Hindu College, University of Delhi](https://hinducollege.ac.in/), with major in Economics in 2020. My primary areas of interest are political economics, impact evaluation methods and network economics. I wish to learn computational/algorithmic methods in the discipline. 

Please [get in touch](mailto:rajivsanjog27@gmail.com)! I'd love to hear from you!
